\subsection{Defining inter-landmark distance traits for \textit{Drosophila serrata}}

Nine landmark positions (LMs), determined by wing vein intersections (see main text Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2MetMRdsgn}), were used to characterise traits of inter-landmark distances (ILDs). Previously, wing shape in \textit{D.~serrata} has been characterised \citep{McGu15, Szte15} using ten ILD traits that were determined in \textit{D. bunnanda}, a sister species of \textit{D. serrata}, and were chosen based on wing coverage and independence (not collinear) \citep{McGu07}. However, multivariate analyses of the same set of ILD traits in \textit{D. serrata} has suffered from problems with multicollinearity (\citealp{Szte15}; \citealp{Duga21}); Aguirre \textit{et al.} unpublished). One solution to this is to simply reduce the number of traits used, eliminating highly correlated traits \citep[e.g.][]{Szte15}. However, this reduces the dimensionality of shape space that can be explored. Therefore, to remedy this problem, a new set of ILD traits were identified that allowed me to maximise the potential dimensions (traits) while eliminating the problem of collinearity. \par

All 36 combinations of ILDs from the nine wing landmarks were investigated. The final ten ILD traits were chosen, as before \citep{McGu07}, with the intent to capture independent variation in wing shape that also maximised wing coverage. To do so, three criteria were used: 1.~included traits had to vary at the genetic level, 2. included traits were not highly correlated (defined below), and 3. traits chosen resulted in good coverage of the wing space, and were not all localised to a particular region. The first criterion was imposed to ensure that zero variance of individual traits did not impede multivariate model convergence, and because the unusual pattern of no genetic (mutational) variance might indicate that traits did not capture any biological variation, only measurement error. This criterion excluded traits ILD3.4, ILD4.9, ILD6.7 and ILD8.9 (main text: Figure~\ref{fig:Fig2MetMRdsgn}; Table ~\ref{tab:CovTest}). Next, the phenotypic correlation matrix was examined (Figure~\ref{fig:CorMAt_36_ILDs}), and we excluded traits stepwise. First, trait pairs that were almost collinear (had $\rho > 0.95$) were identified and a single trait of the pair was retained. When one of the pairs was one of the \textit{D. bunnanda} ILDs previously analysed, preference was given to retain this trait; otherwise, traits were retained at random. This criterion excluded traits ILD1.7, ILD1.8, ILD2.9, ILD3.9, ILD4.6, ILD5.9, ILD6.8 and ILD7.9.\par

Next, we identified groups of traits that were highly correlated ($0.85<\rho<0.95$) because they described similar areas of wing space. For example, ILD2.5, ILD2.6 and ILD2.7 all describe wing depth, thus ILD2.5 was retained (as it was an original ILD). Similarly, landmarks were placed on both ends of the anterior and posterior cross-veins, but cross-vein length was not variable (see criterion 1), and thus ILDs depending on LM6 versus 7 or on LM8 versus 9 were highly collinear. Consequently, from ILD1.6, ILD3.6, ILD3.7, ILD4.7, ILD6.9 and ILD7.8; only ILD3.7 (original) was kept. For ILD1.2, ILD2.3, ILD2.4 and ILD2.8 all distances appear to capture the displacement of LM2 along the wing margin; ILD1.2 and ILD2.8 (original) were kept as they had the lowest correlation coefficients and were capturing other parts of the wing shape. From the remaining 15 wing ILD traits that had correlation coefficients $\leq 0.8$, the final 10 traits were picked to ensure entire wing shape coverage, utilising all nine landmarks.\par

Ten interlandmark distances were calculated from Procrustes aligned residuals, and are defined by their end landmarks, i.e., ILD1.8 is the distance between landmarks 1 and 8.
